### The Ritual
#### Ingredients
We require a few sacred ingredients in order to manifest our Academy:
* Node
* Mysql

#### Preparations
Once you obtain the sacred ingredients, you must cast a few spells.  
First, you must replicate a magic chest from this magic chest.
```shell
git clone git@github.com/seanstrom/quizard.git
```
Second, open the magic chest.
```shell
cd quizard/
```
Third, awaken the magic inside the chest.
```shell
npm install
```

#### The Summoning
Once the preparations are finished, you can begin the Summoning.
```shell
npm start
```

#### Additional Spells
Conjuring the Gauntlet with default riddles and more. (Seed/Reseed)
```shell
npm run toil
```
Create an Aura that will cast the Summoning with phantom Elders and Apprenctices. (Tests) WIP
```shell
npm test
```

#### Words of Caution
Configuration for Mysql are in `src/config/config.json`  
Node 0.12.7 is preferred
